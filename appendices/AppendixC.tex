\chapter{Additional Diagrams and Tables}
\label{appendix:AdditionalDiagramsTables}

(This section would contain the actual graphical diagrams for Figures 1, 2, and 3 if this were a visual document, and any supplementary tables not embedded directly in the main text. As a text-based generation, these were described conceptually earlier.)

\section*{Example of a Table that could be here if not elsewhere:}

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Service Principal API Permissions (Example Minimal Set)}
    \label{tab:ServicePrincipalPermissions}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{6cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{API / Permission Name} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Admin Consent Required} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Microsoft Graph} & & & \\
        \texttt{Sites.ReadWrite.All} & Application & Yes & Read and write items in all site collections (for app install). \\
        \texttt{AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All} & Application & Yes & (If using Graph for App Catalog) Manage submissions to App Catalog. \\
        \hline
        \textbf{SharePoint} & & & \\
        \texttt{Sites.FullControl.All} & Application & Yes & Have full control of all site collections (used by PnP traditionally for app management). Consider \texttt{Sites.Selected} for least privilege. \\
        \texttt{AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All} & Application & Yes & Manage submissions to the SharePoint App Catalog. \\
        \texttt{User.Read} (Graph or SP) & Application & Yes & Required by some PnP cmdlets to resolve user context. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}%
    }
\end{table}

\textit{Note: Always strive for the principle of least privilege. \texttt{Sites.Selected} with specific site permissions granted via Graph or PowerShell is preferred over \texttt{Sites.FullControl.All} or \texttt{Sites.ReadWrite.All} if the scope of operation can be limited.}

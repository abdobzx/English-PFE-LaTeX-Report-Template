 % User's Abstract Content

 % The abstract should be a concise summary of the report, typically around 250-300 words. It should cover the main objectives, methodology, key findings, and conclusions of the project.
 % This project focuses on the design and implementation of a secure and automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions at Sothema. The primary goal is to streamline the development and deployment lifecycle, enhance code quality, and integrate robust security practices. The pipeline leverages Azure DevOps for orchestration, incorporating stages for automated builds, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and security scans), and staged deployments to development, staging, and production environments. Key security measures include Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarQube, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP, and dependency analysis using WhiteSource/GitHub Dependabot. Secrets management is handled through Azure Key Vault. The implemented CI/CD pipeline has demonstrated significant improvements in deployment efficiency, reduction in manual errors, and a strengthened security posture for SPFx solutions. This report details the project's methodology, the architecture of the CI/CD pipeline, the tools and technologies employed, the challenges encountered, and the results achieved, along with recommendations for future enhancements.

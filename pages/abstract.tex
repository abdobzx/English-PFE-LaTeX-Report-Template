This report details a four-month end-of-studies project (PFE) undertaken within the IT department of Société Thérapeutique Marocaine (Sothema). The primary objective was to design, implement, and secure a fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. This initiative aimed to modernize Sothema's development practices, enhance deployment reliability, improve security posture, and accelerate the delivery of new functionalities to the corporate SharePoint Online environment. The project involved leveraging Azure DevOps for orchestration, Azure Repos for version control, Docker for containerization, Trivy for vulnerability scanning, Playwright for end-to-end testing, and PowerShell for deployment automation. This report outlines the project context, methodology, technical implementation, results, challenges encountered, and recommendations for future work, underscoring the value of DevSecOps principles in a modern pharmaceutical enterprise.
